    "#### Covid-19 pandemic has swept across the world, and local authorities are keen to curb the spread of the pandemic for public health and safety. The key to stopping the chain of transmission is to understand where the infections have occurred or where the infected have visited. Analysing these locations would be useful to determine where clusters are forming and if any patterns to these locations can be determined, then more efforts can be taken for safety and precautionary measures to prevent the spread of the virus at similar places."
